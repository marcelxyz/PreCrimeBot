# Getting data

Due to the size of the training data set, it is not included in this repo.

Head over to https://data.police.uk/data/ and download all available data for the
`Metropolitan Police Service` and `City of London Police` police forces into this directory.

After extracting, this is what the tree structure of this directory should look like:

```
data/
├── YYYY-MM
│   ├── YYYY-MM-city-of-london-street.csv
│   └── YYYY-MM-metropolitan-street.csv
├── ...
├── YYYY-MM
│   ├── YYYY-MM-city-of-london-street.csv
│   └── YYYY-MM-metropolitan-street.csv
└── README.md
```
